# Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
A list of practical projects that we will work through these processese:

- installing TensorFlow in your local environment
- Learn some basics of how to use TensorFlow API
- Implement a classical linear regression model with TensorFlow
- Implement a k-means for clustering images
- Import and Train a model with FashionNIST dataset
- Predict new images based on the trained model
