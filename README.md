# Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
A list of practical projects that we will work through these processese:

- installing TensorFlow in your local environment
- Learn some basics of how to use TensorFlow API
- Implement a classical linear regression model with TensorFlow
- Implement a k-means for clustering images
- Import and Train a model with FashionNIST dataset
- Predict new images based on the trained model
## Set Up
Task 0.1. tf requires a numpy update
```
!pip install numpy --upgrade
```
Task 0.2. install tensorflow (latest version won't work for this project)
```
!pip install tensorflow == 1.14.0 
```
Task 0.3 install keras API
```
!pip install keras --upgrade
```
