# Deep-Learning-with-TensorFlow
### In this project we will work through the process of:

##### 1.installing TensorFlow in your local environment
##### 2.Learn some basics of how to use TensorFlow API
##### 3.Implement a classical linear regression model with TensorFlow
##### 4.Implement a k-means for clustering images
##### 5.Import and Train a model with FashionNIST dataset
##### 6.Predict new images based on the trained model
